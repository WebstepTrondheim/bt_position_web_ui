# BtPositionWebUi

## Dependencies

This app depends on [bt_position](https://github.com/WebstepTrondheim/bt_position). 

`bt_position` is currently runnig on `velferd.digital`. And thus you don't need to start it yourself.

If you don't get any messages it might mean that the app is not runnig on `velferd.digital`. 

You can run `bt_position` yourself but **check with all people involved** in the project since you may create **duplicate messages for everybody else**.

To run `bt_position` locally it should be in the same folder as this project.
